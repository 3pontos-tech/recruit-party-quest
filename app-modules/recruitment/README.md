# Recruitment Module

## Overview

The **Recruitment** module is the core of the hiring system, managing job requisitions, job postings, and pipeline stages. It handles the complete lifecycle of a position from internal approval through public posting to candidate evaluation stages.

## Context

This module represents the employer's side of the recruitment process. It manages what positions are being hired for, how they're presented to candidates, and what stages candidates must go through during the hiring process.

```
Draft           → Initial creation (✏️)
PendingApproval → Awaiting approval (⏰)
Approved        → Approved, not published (✅)
Published       → Live and accepting applications (🚩)
OnHold          → Temporarily paused (⏸️)
Closed          → Filled or completed (❌)
Cancelled       → Cancelled entirely (🚫)
```

### RequisitionPriorityEnum

```
Low      → Can wait
Normal   → Standard priority
High     → Urgent hire
Critical → Business-critical
```

### EmploymentTypeEnum

```
FullTimeEmployee → Permanent full-time (💼)
Contractor       → Contract/1099 (📄)
Intern           → Internship (🎓)
Temporary        → Temp position (📅)
PartTime         → Part-time (⏰)
```

### WorkArrangementEnum

> **There are no "terminal" stages.** Rejection, withdrawal and a declined offer
> are **status overlays** on `ApplicationStatusEnum` (see the Applications
> module) — they freeze the application on its current stage and never consume a
> pipeline stage. The `Rejected`/`Declined` stage types were removed in #168.

## Requisition Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Create Requisition

    Draft --> PendingApproval: Submit for Approval
    Draft --> Cancelled: Cancel

    PendingApproval --> Approved: Manager Approves
    PendingApproval --> Draft: Request Changes
    PendingApproval --> Cancelled: Reject

    Approved --> Published: Publish Job
    Approved --> OnHold: Put on Hold

```

## Pipeline Configuration

When a `JobRequisition` is created, `JobRequisitionObserver` seeds **6 default
stages** (durations in days). Each stage is fully customizable per requisition.

## Business Rules

### Requisition Management

1. **Approval Flow**: Requisitions must be approved before publishing
2. **Ownership**: Each requisition belongs to a team and department
3. **Hiring Manager**: A designated user responsible for the hire
4. **Confidential**: Some searches are hidden from general view

### Job Posting

1. **One-to-One**: Each requisition has at most one public posting
2. **Rich Content**: Job details stored as structured JSON for flexibility
3. **SEO Friendly**: Slugs generated for clean URLs
4. **Accessibility**: Supports disability-confident employers

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Ordered**: Stages have a defined order
2. **Typed**: Each stage has a type (Screening, Interview, etc.)
3. **Interviewers**: Multiple interviewers can be assigned per stage
4. **Flexible**: Each requisition can have a custom pipeline
